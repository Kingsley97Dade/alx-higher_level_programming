<h1>Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples</h1>
<h2>Print a list of integers</h2>
<p>A function that prints all integers of a list</p>
<h2>Secure access to an element in a list</h2>
<p>A function that retrieves an element from a list like in C</p>
<h2>Replace element</h2>
<p>A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C)</p>
<h2>Print a list of integers... in reverse!</h2>
<p>A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order</p>
<h2>Replace in a copy</h2>
<p>A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)</p>
<h2>Can you C me now?</h2>
<p>A function that removes all characters c and C from a string</p>
<h2>Lists of lists = Matrix</h2>
<p>A function that prints a matrix of integers</p>
<h2>Tuples addition</h2>
<p>A function that adds 2 tuples</p>
<h2>More returns!</h2>
<p>A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character</p>
<h2>Find the max</h2>
<p>A function that finds the biggest integer of a list</p>
<h2>Only by 2</h2>
<p>A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list</p>
<h2>Delete at</h2>
<p>A function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list</p>
<h2>Switch</h2>
<p>Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b</p>
<h2>Linked list palindrome</h2>
<p>A function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome</p>
<h2>CPython #0: Python lists</h2>
<p>CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
Since we now know a bit of C, we can look at what is happening under the hood of Python. Let’s have fun with Python and C, and let’s look at what makes Python so easy to use.</p>
